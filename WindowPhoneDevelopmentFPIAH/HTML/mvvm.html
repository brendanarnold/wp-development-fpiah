   <h2>
    Introduction
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     MVVM stands for Model, View, View-Model
    </li>
    <li>
     It is just a
     <a class="glossaryterm" href="glossary.html#pattern">
      pattern
     </a>
     , however you should follow it unless you have a good reason not to
    </li>
    <li>
     It organises your code into three roles for your code,
     <ul class="compact">
      <li>
       'View' code deals with the user interface (UI)
      </li>
      <li>
       'Model' code stores the application data
      </li>
      <li>
       'View-Model' code is (usually) a single object that interfaces the View code with the Model code
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     The MVVM pattern works well in Windows Phone because of 'Data Binding'
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h2>
    Data binding
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     To save writing lots of code to read and write data to and from the View (UI), the View can 'bind' most XAML attributes to a property of a C# object.
    </li>
    <li>
     When the 'bound' C# property changes, this is automatically reflected in the View and (optionally) vice-versa
    </li>
    <li>
     We write the View-Model object to be the bound object
    </li>
    <li>
     This structure allows most application logic to be concerned with making changes on the View-Model object in C# - the View automatically updates accordingly
    </li>
    <li>
     We will examine how this is actually implemented in
     <a href="binding.html">
      Data binding for people in a hurry
     </a>
    </li>
   </ul>

    <img width="70%" height="70%" src="images/binding_figure.png" />
   </div>
   <h2>
    Benefits of MVVM
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Lots of the UI coding is taken care of
    </li>
    <li>
     Expression Blend has tools to mock up a fake View-Model object with sample data so you can design the UI without a working C# backend
    </li>
    <li>
     A de-coupled View makes substituting another View (e.g. web or desktop frontend) more straightforward
    </li>
    <li>
     Unit testing is easier since there is virtually no programming logic in the UI, the backend is pure C# and also the UI is not required for the app to compile and run
    </li>
    <li>
     However, with only the free development tools, writing the getters/setters plus appropriate events all bound View-Model properties to get it to work is tedious
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h2>
    Implementing MVVM
   </h2>
   <p>
    The
    <a href="skeleton.html">
     skeleton project
    </a>
    contains a directory for each of these roles. Files are organised into these directories depending on their role
   </p>
   <h3>
    View
   </h3>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Pages and UserControls (i.e. custom widgets) defined in XAML and their <a class="glossaryterm" href="glossary.html#codebehind">code behind files</a> (i.e. the .cs or .vb files that are linked to the .xaml file in the Visual Studio project explorer) belong in the View
    </li>
    <li>
     In the code-behind files we generally put only code to handle UI behaviour (e.g. showing a MessageBox or handling a button click)
    </li>
    <li>
     If a button click does something that is not to do with the UI, for example save an object to a database, then the code-behind should immediately call a method on the View-Model
    </li>
    <li>
     It should be possible to remove the View code folder from the project and the application should still compile and run (albeit with no way to input or output data)
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h3>
    Model
   </h3>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Code that implements the interface for the <a class="glossaryterm" href="glossary.html#datasource">data source</a> (e.g. database, XML files, webservice etc.) belongs in the Model
    </li>
    <li>
     However the actual calling of the interface should be done in the View-Model
    </li>
    <li>
     The classes that contain the data from the <a class="glossaryterm" href="glossary.html#datasource">data source</a> e.g.  the 'Customer' class and the 'Invoice' class belong in the Model
    </li>
    <li>
     However, collections of these classes, for example to be displayed in a list in the View, should be in the View-Model
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h3>
    View-Model
   </h3>
   <ul>
    <li>
     The object that provides the properties for UI binding is the View-Model
    </li>
    <li>
     Methods that takes the raw data from the Model and process it for the UI go in the View-Model class
    </li>
    <li>
     Methods that process submitted user input to be saved to the Model goes in the View-Model class
    </li>
    <li>
     Smaller applications usually have one View-Model class for the entire application, larger applications may split so that there is one View-Model class for every XAML page
    </li>
    <li>
     A good place for the View-Model object is on the
     <code>
      App
     </code>
     object which is globally accessible,
     <ul class="compact">
      <li>
       Create a public property 'VM' for the View-Model in the App.xaml.cs code-behind. This can be instantiated in the constructor. Now you can access the same View-Model instance anywhere in the app using
       <code>
        App.VM
       </code>
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     Write the View-Model so that slow operations do not all occur at the same time when the app is loading e.g. if your app reads a lot of data from a database, only load enough to display the loading page
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h3>
    Other code
   </h3>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Other code which does not easily fall into one of the three categories such as e.g. code for processing speech, can be put in a separate directory
    </li>
   </ul>
